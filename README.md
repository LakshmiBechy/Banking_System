## Introduction
The project aims to replicate a simplified version of a banking system in Python, using by object-oriented programming principles.
The core of this application is the Customer class, which provides essential features to manage customer details and perform various banking operations.

#### Class Features
The Customer class is designed to store customer information, including their name, unique account number, PIN number for security, current account balance, 
and the date of account creation.

#### Class Methods
The Customer class provides the following methods to facilitate banking operations:
1. Deposit money
2. Withdraw money
3. View account balance
4. View transactions
5. Close Account

#### Other Functions
Apart from the Customer class, additional functions are included to enhance the overall user experience:

Create Account Function: This function enables new customers to open bank accounts.

Login Function: It allows users to access their accounts and perform transactions like depositing, withdrawing, checking account balance, viewing transaction history, and closing accounts if needed. Users can also log out for privacy and security.
